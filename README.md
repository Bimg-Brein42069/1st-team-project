Instructions to operate the file:

1) open linux terminal and type make
2) then run ./bmptoico
3) then enter source bitmap file name(or full path of source file)
4) ls to check for destination icon file
5) remove the extra file by typing make clean

This converter works best for 8 bit .bmp files(converts them to .ico files)
